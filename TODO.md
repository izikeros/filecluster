TODO list
==========

- for some reason after cluster id=1 there is cluster id=3 created - debug this
- rich directories (with many files) sortable to the top (cover 20%/50%/80% of files? All above 10?)
- check for duplicates before import
- add photos to clusters existing in watch folder (structured repo)
- read config from the dot file as here: https://www.foxinfotech.in/2019/01/how-to-read-config-file-in-python.html

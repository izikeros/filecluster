* Manual post-processing on miniatures
    * (A) generate thumbnails of inbox_clustered (in inbox_clustered_mini) to 
allow manual rename and refine clustering
    * rearrange original inbox_clusterred to mimic structure in 
inbox_clustered_mini after rearrangement
* add web UI to merge subsequent clusters
* generate basic sidecar files
* add sidecar with location to cr2 files if location available in photos 
from phone
* deep learning:
    * detect blurry photos
    * face detection
    * detect documents
    * detect Natalia's selfies
    * detect photo series (similar shots) (low resolution comparison?)
    * learn which is best photo (representative photo)
